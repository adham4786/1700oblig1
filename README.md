# 1700oblig1
I messed up when initializing the github repo. 
Somehow I started committing to "master" branch instead of "main" branch as intended.
Didn't realize until I was going through the project on github before submitting,
because it is in the "main" folder locally on my PC.
I fixed this to get it correctly in the file structure for the oblig
by renaming the master branch here on github to main.
Hope this is an acceptable fix :)
