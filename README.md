# 1700oblig1
Please ignore the "PREVIOUSmain" branch.
I must have made an error when initializing the GitHub repo.
Everything should be fine now, and everything is in the "main" branch.
Other than that I haven't published this to GitHub pages since the oblig says just link GitHub repo.
Hopefully, everything works fine :)
